I used a small set of digital bricks and next made images of the brick while it was rotated in the x, y and z axis. At that time I used Blender as the rendering software. Based on the feedback I got from Kaggler users, thanks for this, I decided to create a version 2 dataset. This time I am going to use Maya software from Autodesk (I used the Maya 2020 trial version) which is in my opinion easier to use. In this notebook I explain step by step how I created the dataset."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Creating the set of digital Lego bricks\n","I decided to use [Mecabricks](https://www.mecabricks.com/) to selected and generate digital models of the LEGO bricks. Each brick is exported as Collada (.dae) file because this is file format recognized by Autodesk Maya. I decided to take middle gray tone as color (so centered approximately around half RGB range 0..255) because if color is required then this can be applied later on the finished rendered image.\n","\n","A list is provided of all Collada files in the [Kaggle Lego Bricks dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/joosthazelzet/lego-brick-images/)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Setting up the scene in Maya using 2 cameras\n","The approach is to load a digital brick to a pivot point.
